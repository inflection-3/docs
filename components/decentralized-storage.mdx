Decentralized Storage ensures Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and profile data are stored in a tamper-resistant, globally accessible manner, using protocols like IPFS. By storing data off-chain and anchoring hashes on-chain, this component supports scalability while maintaining verifiability.

## Theoretical Role

- **Data Distribution**: Stores VCs across a decentralized network.
- **Content Addressing**: Generates unique hashes for data retrieval.
- **On-Chain Linkage**: Anchors hashes in the IdentityRegistry for trust.

## Explanation

- **Storage**: VCs are stored off-chain for scalability.
- **Verification**: Hashes link to on-chain registry for trust.
