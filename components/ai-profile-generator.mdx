The AI Profile Generator theoretically processes reputation graph data to create economic profiles, such as credit scores, formatted as Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Using machine learning models, it infers user attributes from transaction patterns, enabling dynamic and accurate profile generation for financial applications.

## Theoretical Role

- **Data Aggregation**: Collects metrics (e.g., transaction volume, frequency) from the graph.
- **AI Inference**: Applies models to predict economic attributes (e.g., creditworthiness).
- **VC Output**: Formats profiles as W3C-compliant VCs for sharing.

## Explanation

- **Input to Output**: Graph metrics are transformed into VC claims.
- **AI Role**: Inference ensures accurate, dynamic profiles.
