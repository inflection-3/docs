The **Inflection DID system** comprises the following theoretical components, each focused on enabling **DIDs, VCs, and ZKPs** for a decentralized economic identity layer:

---

## IdentityRegistry Smart Contract
- Anchors **DIDs** and **VC hashes** on-chain.  
- Ensures **immutability** and **verifiability**.  

---

## Transaction Listener
- Monitors **stablecoin transactions**.  
- Feeds **reputation data** into the system.  

---

## Reputation Graph Engine
- Models **user interactions** as a graph.  
- Computes **reputation metrics** for economic profiling.  

---

## AI Profile Generator
- Processes **graph data** using AI.  
- Produces **economic profiles** expressed as **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**.  

---

## Decentralized Storage
- Stores **VCs off-chain** for **scalability and accessibility**.  
- Example: **IPFS** or similar systems.  

---

## Zero-Knowledge Proof System
- Enables **privacy-preserving proofs** of profile attributes.  
- Allows claims (e.g., *“Reputation > 200”*) without exposing underlying data.  

---

## Inflection SDK
- Provides **developer tools** to integrate external protocols.  
- Enables **verification** and **profile queries** across ecosystems.  

---

Each component is detailed in its **respective page**, including **theoretical roles** and **supporting diagrams**.
