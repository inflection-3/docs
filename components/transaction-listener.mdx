The **Transaction Listener** is a theoretical component that monitors **stablecoin transactions** (e.g., **USDC transfers**) on the Inflection blockchain.

It captures **real-time transaction data**—such as **sender, receiver, and amount**—to feed into the **reputation graph**, enabling **dynamic updates** to user profiles.

This component bridges **on-chain activity** with **off-chain processing**, ensuring **responsiveness without centralized control**.

## Theoretical Role

- **Event Monitoring**: Listens for blockchain events (e.g., ERC20 `Transfer` events).
- **Data Extraction**: Parses transaction details (e.g., `from`, `to`, `value`) for reputation metrics.
- **Integration Trigger**: Initiates updates to the reputation graph and smart contract.
