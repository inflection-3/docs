The **IdentityRegistry** is a blockchain-based smart contract that serves as the **immutable foundation** for the Inflection DID system.  

It anchors **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** to user wallet addresses, stores **Verifiable Credential (VC) hashes**, and tracks **reputation scores** derived from stablecoin transactions.  

By residing on a blockchain (e.g., **Ethereum** or **Sepolia** for testing), it ensures that identities are **tamper-proof** and **verifiable** by any protocol, supporting the system’s goal of a **decentralized economic identity layer**.

## Theoretical Role
- **DID Anchoring:** Registers unique DIDs to prevent duplication and enable global lookup.  
- **VC Integration:** Stores hashes of VCs, linking off-chain data to on-chain proof.  
- **Reputation Tracking:** Maintains dynamic reputation scores, updated by transaction-driven processes.  
- **Verification Support:** Allows external protocols to confirm identity authenticity and profile validity.
