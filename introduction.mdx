## Overview
The **Inflection DID system** is a decentralized identity framework designed to empower users with portable, AI-enhanced economic profiles derived from stablecoin transactions.  

It establishes a **Global Economic Identity Layer**—a decentralized reputation graph that facilitates trustless financial interactions, such as credit assessment and lending, across blockchains.  

This theoretical documentation outlines the conceptual foundations of the system, focusing on:
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**  

These ensure **privacy, interoperability, and user sovereignty**.  

By leveraging **blockchain immutability** and **off-chain scalability**, Inflection DID enables users to control their financial reputation and share it selectively with external protocols without centralized intermediaries.  

The system aligns with **W3C DID** and **VC standards**, ensuring compatibility with diverse blockchain ecosystems.

## Key Concepts

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):**  
  Unique, user-controlled identifiers tied to cryptographic keys, enabling self-sovereign identity.

- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):**  
  Cryptographically signed digital proofs of attributes (e.g., reputation scores), verifiable by third parties.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):**  
  Cryptographic techniques to prove claims (e.g., *"reputation > 200"*) without revealing underlying data.

- **Reputation Graph:**  
  A network model of user interactions, where nodes are users and edges represent stablecoin transactions, used to compute economic profiles.

## Benefits

- **Privacy:** Selective disclosure via ZKPs protects sensitive data.  
- **Interoperability:** DIDs and VCs work across blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).  
- **Scalability:** Off-chain processing for computation-intensive tasks.  
- **Decentralization:** Eliminates reliance on central authorities.
