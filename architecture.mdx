## High-Level Architecture
The **Inflection DID architecture** is a layered system balancing **security, scalability, and privacy**.  

It processes **stablecoin transactions** to build a **reputation graph**, generates **AI-driven economic profiles as VCs**, and enables **private sharing via ZKPs**.  

- **On-chain components** ensure immutability.  
- **Off-chain components** handle computation and storage for efficiency.  

### Layers
- **Identity Layer:** Creates and anchors DIDs to user wallets.  
- **Data Layer:** Monitors transactions and builds reputation graphs.  
- **Profile Layer:** Generates VCs from AI-inferred profiles.  
- **Sharing Layer:** Facilitates private, interoperable sharing via ZKPs and an SDK.
